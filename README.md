# ETLDataPipeline_with_AWSGlue_and_AWSLambda

**ETL Data Pipeline with AWS Glue and Lambda**

Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using AWS Glue and Lambda. The pipeline is designed to automate the process of ingesting, transforming, and loading data from a source to a target location, making it easy to manage and process different datasets.

Features:
AWS Glue ETL Jobs: Utilizes AWS Glue to define and execute ETL jobs for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
Serverless Trigger: AWS Lambda is used to trigger the Glue ETL job, making it a serverless and event-driven architecture.
Easy Maintenance: Simplifies data pipeline management and maintenance by leveraging AWS managed services.
